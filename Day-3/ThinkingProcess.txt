Part 1:
For part 1, I knew I needed to iterate through each level of the mountain,
    checking every 3 spots for a "#" which indicated a tree

I attained this by setting a trees hit variable and a right travel variable

Each iteration, I would check if the right travel variable was over 30, 
    since each level was originally 31 characters long, which meant the last
    index would always be 30.
If it was, I would subtract a whole line from the variable, that is, 31. To replicate
    the strings replicating into infinity.
Next, I would check if the character at the index location was a "#",
    and if it was, I would increase the count variable by 1

This way, I returned a count of 193, which was correct.

Part 2:
For part 2, all that was added into the mix was varying "slopes". 
Then, return the product of all the trees hit for the varying slopes.

The easy parts were the slopes where down was still 1, where all I needed to do
    was to change the right increment.

The only only one that required a bit more manipulation was where the down increment was 2
For this, I modified the for loop statement to iterate through a range that would
    increment by two.
Then I modified the if statement to use mountain[i] rather than just i.

Finally, I stored each of the trees hit for each of the slopes and multipled them together.

This way, I returned a product of 1355323200, which was correct.
