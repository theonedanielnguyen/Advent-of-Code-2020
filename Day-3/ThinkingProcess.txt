Part 1:
For part 1, I knew I needed to iterate through each level of the mountain,
    checking every 3 spots for a "#" which indicated a tree

I attained this by setting a trees hit variable and a right travel variable

Each iteration, I would check if the right travel variable was over 30, 
    since each level was originally 31 characters long, which meant the last
    index would always be 30.
If it was, I would subtract a whole line from the variable, that is, 31. To replicate
    the strings replicating into infinity.
Next, I would check if the character at the index location was a "#",
    and if it was, I would increase the count variable by 1

This way, I returned a count of 193, which was correct.
