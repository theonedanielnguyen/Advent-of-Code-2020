Part 1:

For part one, the requests were:
    1. Find all passwords that are valid according to the following:
        Strings written as: num-num char: string;
        Where the numbers indicate a range that the character must appear in the string that many times.
    2. Return the total valid password strings.

For this, I knew all I had to do was to break down the strings into their individual parts to work

Because all of the strings were formatted in the same way, I was able to split them easily.

Then, using a for loop, I iterated through the separated strings and :
    Set the two numbers to the min amount and max amount
    Set the character to be searched for
    Iterated through the string for matches and increasing a count variable with every match
    And finally, checked if the count variable was within the stated bounds
    If the count was within bounds, I increased an external count variable

From this, I returned the value of 607, which was the correct answer
