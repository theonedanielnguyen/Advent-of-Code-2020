Part 1:
    For part one, we were tasked with finding the total sum of counts of yes
        to an array of questions that each group answered.

    To solve this, I realized that using a set would be the easiest way.

    So, I combined all strings of yes answers in a group into one string, then,
        because it is iterable, I converted the string into a set, which only
        allows for each value to only appear once.
    
    Then, I summed the length of each of those sets into the final sum.

    From this, I returned a sum of 6930, which was the correct answer.

Part 2:
    For part two, we were tasked with finding the the total sum of the joined
        counts of yes.

    To solve this, I believed that using a set would still be the right way to go.

    I created a set out of the first string of yes answers in a group.

    Then, I iterated through all the member strings in a group and would iterate
        through the original set to check if each value was present.
    
    If the value was not present in a string, I removed the value from the set.

    At the end, I added the sum of all the set lengths together to get the final sum.

    From this, I returned a sum of 3585, which was the correct answer.
