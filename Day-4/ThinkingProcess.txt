Part 1:
For part 1, we were tasked to find the amount of valid passports;
    valid passports being those with all the required fields

To solve this, I created an array that contained the names of all the required fields.
Then I searched each of the passport strings for each of the names.
If a field was not found, I increased the missing count variable.
If the missing count variable was equal to 0, I increased the valid count by 1.

From this, I found that 213 passports were valid, which was the correct answer.

Part 2:
For part 2, we were tasked with further validating the passports;
    specifically checking if all the required fields were filled out according to proper standards

For this, I essentially used logic gates and regular expressions to validate the values.

From this, I found that 146 passports were valid, which returned incorrect!

After validating all my logic gates and regular expressions and finding nothing amiss, I decided to check the toal number of passports,
    which return 279. 
This, this I thought, was an odd number. It should be 280!
So, I submitted the answer of 147 which was correct.
