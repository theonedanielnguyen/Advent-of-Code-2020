Part 1:
For part 1, we were tasked to find the amount of valid passports;
    valid passports being those with all the required fields

To solve this, I created an array that contained the names of all the required fields.
Then I searched each of the passport strings for each of the names.
If a field was not found, I increased the missing count variable.
If the missing count variable was equal to 0, I increased the valid count by 1.

From this, I found that 213 passports were valid, which was the correct answer.
