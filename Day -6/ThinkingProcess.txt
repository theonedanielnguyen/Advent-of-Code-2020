Part 1:
    For part one, we were tasked with finding the total sum of counts of yes
        to an array of questions that each group answered.

    To solve this, I realized that using a set would be the easiest way.

    So, I combined all strings of yes answers in a group into one string, then,
        because it is iterable, I converted the string into a set, which only
        allows for each value to only appear once.
    
    Then, I summed the length of each of those sets into the final sum.

    From this I returned a sum of 6930, which was the correct answer.
